              I'm Tiago, a creative designer from Brazil currently located in Barcelona.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              From the outset, I've been driven by my creative and ambivalent essence, a<br />
              combination that allows me to explore different paths and approaches in<br />
              everything I do.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              One of my most striking abilities is the capacity to bring people and groups<br />
              together, creating meaningful connections that drive project success.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Grounded in values such as empathy and communication, I consider these<br />
              pillars essential to my performance in any project. With a solid experience as<br />
              a graphic designer, accumulated in various companies in Brazil, I've<br />
              developed a broad and versatile view of the design world.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Recently, I completed a master's degree in UX UI Design at Nuclio Digital<br />
              School, where I deepened my knowledge and mastery of the latest trends<br />
              and practices in the field of user experience and user interface design.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              My professional journey also led me to an enriching four-and-a-half-year<br />
              experience in Barcelona, where I worked as Customer Service on a Google<br />
              project. This experience broadened my global perspective and honed my<br />
              communication and customer service skills.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In addition to my involvement in the design world, one of my great passions<br />
              is music. I majored in Literature and built a solid career as a songwriter/<br />
              composer and musician, bringing a unique sensitivity and diverse creative<br />
              approach to all aspects of my professional life.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I will help you develop your digital product based on a better user<br />
              experience.
