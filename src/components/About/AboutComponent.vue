                I'm Tiago, a creative designer from Brazil currently located in Barcelona.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the outset, I've been driven by my creative and ambivalent essence, a
                combination that allows me to explore different paths and approaches in
                everything I do.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of my most striking abilities is the capacity to bring people and groups
                together, creating meaningful connections that drive project success.
              </p>
              <p>
                Grounded in values such as empathy and communication, I consider these
                pillars essential to my performance in any project. With a solid experience as
                a graphic designer, accumulated in various companies in Brazil, I've
                developed a broad and versatile view of the design world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recently, I completed a master's degree in UX UI Design at Nuclio Digital
                School, where I deepened my knowledge and mastery of the latest trends
                and practices in the field of user experience and user interface design.
              </p>
              <p>
                My professional journey also led me to an enriching four-and-a-half-year
                experience in Barcelona, where I worked as Customer Service on a Google
                project. This experience broadened my global perspective and honed my
                communication and customer service skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to my involvement in the design world, one of my great passions
                is music. I majored in Literature and built a solid career as a songwriter/
                composer and musician, bringing a unique sensitivity and diverse creative
                approach to all aspects of my professional life.
              </p>
              <p>
                I will help you develop your digital product based on a better user
                experience.
